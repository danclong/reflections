Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. When you init' a repo, a .git folder is stored in the directory so that we
know the directory is a valid git folder. We have to do this so that git knows
to track the files within it (as long as you commit them).

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. The staging area is 'half way' between the working directory and the repo.
Files are added to the staging area before being commited to the repo. Using
the stagin area allows you to manage what gets commited - so to split your
files logically.
