Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. You would do this when you want to work with other people.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. Pulling changes manually is always safer than making having Git automatically do it.
There might be things added which you do not want in your branch.
